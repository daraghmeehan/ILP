# ILP

This is my solution to the simulation of the game of 'Powergrab'. The project was the focus of the first semester 3rd Year course Informatics Large Practical in the University of Edinburgh (2019/2020).

The file ILP specification is the specification document for the system.

The folder powergrab is my solution (written in Java and built in Maven), while the file ILP report.pdf is my written report on the system I made.
